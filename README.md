# David Kim

Welcome to my personal website: [davidernesto.io](https://davidernesto.io)

I'm David Ernesto Kim — an entrepreneur, engineer, and builder passionate about creating impactful ventures across technology, finance, and emerging markets.  

My journey combines a background in Applied Mathematics from Columbia University with hands-on experience as a Software Engineer, Product Manager, Investor, and Startup Founder. I’m driven by the belief that with the right vision, discipline, and energy, we can build businesses that shape industries, empower communities, and leave lasting legacies.

Currently, I’m focused on:  
- **Fintech innovation** for emerging markets (stablecoins, digital banking, and blockchain infrastructure)  
- **Entrepreneurship** (consumer products, tech platforms, and financial ventures)  
- **Personal growth and productivity**, building systems for life-long learning and leadership  

This site is a home for my ideas, projects, and reflections — a living snapshot of the journey.
